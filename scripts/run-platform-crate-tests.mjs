/**
 * Run `cargo test` for the platform core crates.
 *
 * Closes the gap at platform-development-plan.md:269 — `datazen-runtime` was
 * linked by CI (`cargo test --lib -p datazen --lib`) but never tested, so the
 * one crate the server will be built on could compile clean and still be wrong.
 *
 * ## Why this is a script and not a list in ci.yml
 *
 * Precedent: ci.yml:96 carries the comment 「驱动集合只写在
 * `run-unit-driver-set.mjs`，不要内联到这里」 for the driver test set. The same
 * argument applies with more force here, because the platform crates are *being
 * written right now* by another track — `packages/application` and
 * `packages/platform-api` are landing in a parallel branch. A `-p` list in
 * ci.yml would have to be edited the day they merge; a list derived from the
 * same LAYERS table the boundary guard uses is edited never, and cannot drift
 * from the guard's idea of what a core crate is.
 *
 * ## Why an unclassified member stops the run instead of reddening it at the end
 *
 * `lib/cargoWorkspace.mjs` classifies a member by the directory it lives in, and
 * a member matching no layer path is an **error on purpose**: a member this
 * classifier cannot place is a member no rule covers. The sibling gate enforces
 * that by folding `index.unclassified` into its exit code (`errors` at :367-368
 * → `failed = violations.length + errors.length` at :532-534). This script used
 * to print the identical ERROR line and then fall through — the message went to
 * stderr while execution continued and ended in `return 0` (`--dry-run`, :117-120)
 * or in cargo's own code (:128-129). Measured at c3cf61fef on a workspace with
 * one unclassifiable member: the guard exited 1, this runner exited 0 on both
 * the `--dry-run` path and the real `cargo test` path.
 *
 * **The choice here is to abort before testing, not to aggregate into the final
 * code**, for one reason. The crate list this script tests is derived from the
 * same classification, so once a member is unclassifiable that list is known to
 * be incomplete — the unclassified member may itself be a `runtime`-layer crate
 * that belongs in the tested set. Aggregating would still print
 * `PASS — N core crate(s) tested`, a coverage claim the same run has just
 * disproved, and that line is the one a reader skims. Failing before the claim
 * is made cannot mislead anyone.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by stopping: the observable CI contract is identical either
 * way (same stderr, same exit 1), the fix for an unclassified member is a
 * one-line `LAYERS` edit rather than a debugging session, and there is no reason
 * to spend cargo's time proving the rest of the set is green before saying so.
 * `check-platform-crate-boundaries.mjs` already takes the opposite-but-equally-
 * deliberate route — it aggregates, because it has more than one rule to report
 * — and it aborts early on its own input defect (`aborted: no spec`). The rule
 * followed by both is the one that matters: never emit a green result over a
 * workspace the classifier could not fully account for.
 *
 * Placing the abort during discovery, before the dry-run branch, is deliberate:
 * `--dry-run` must not be a bypass, and dry-run exists to show the plan, not to
 * skip the plan's own validity check.
 *
 * @example
 * node scripts/run-platform-crate-tests.mjs --dry-run
